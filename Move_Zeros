Approach:
1) set two pointers left & right
2) left will be set to 0 and right one will be iterating
3) will check if the right element isn't equal to zero and will swap right to left & left to right.
4) After each iteration left pointer would be moving to next forward location in array.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        left=0
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right]!=0:
                nums[right],nums[left]=nums[left], nums[right]
                left=left+1
